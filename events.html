                        <h2>3D Animation</h2>
                        <p style="padding-top: 1.5rem;">Participants (two [2] teams of two [2] to six [6] members per state) demonstrate their knowledge of 3D animation technology and design skills to creatively solve the challenge posted on <a href="https://tsaweb.org/competitions-programs/tsa/themes-problems">Themes and Problems</a>.</p>

                        <h2>Animatronics</h2>
                        <p style="padding-top: 1.5rem;">Participants (one [1] team per chapter) demonstrate knowledge of mechanical and control systems by designing, fabricating, and controlling an animatronics device that will communicate, entertain, inform, demonstrate and/or illustrate a topic, idea, subject, or concept. Sound, lights, and a surrounding environment must accompany the device.</p>
                        
                        <h2>Architectural Design</h2>
                        <p style="padding-top: 1.5rem;">Participants (one [1] team, or one [1] individual, per chapter) develop a set of architectural plans and related materials for an annual architectural design challenge and construct a physical, as well as a computer-generated model, to accurately depict their design.</p>

                        <h2>Biotechnology Design</h2>
                        <p style="padding-top: 1.5rem;">Participants (one [1] team or one [1] individual per chapter) select a contemporary biotechnology problem (that relates to the current year’s published topic) and demonstrate understanding of it through documented research, the development of a solution, a display (including an optional model or prototype), and an effective multimedia presentation.</p>

                        <h2>Coding</h2>
                        <p style="padding-top: 1.5rem;">Participants (one [1] individual, or one [1] team of two [2] members, per chapter) respond to an annual coding-related design challenge by developing a software program that will accurately address an on-site problem in a specified, limited amount of time.</p>

                        <h2>Computer-Aided Design (CAD), Engineering</h2>
                        <p style="padding-top: 1.5rem;">Participants (two [2] individuals per state) use complex computer graphic skills, tools, and processes to develop three-dimensional representations of engineering subjects such as a machine part, tool, device, or manufactured product.</p>

                        <h2>Engineering Design</h2>
                        <p style="padding-top: 1.5rem;">Participants (three [3] teams of three to six [3 - 6] members per state) develop a solution to a National Academy of Engineering grand challenge that is posted on the national TSA website. The solution offered will be informed and designed by precise problem definition, thorough research, creativity, experimentation (when possible), and the development of documents and appropriate models (mathematical, graphical, and/or physical prototype/model). Semifinalist teams present and defend their proposed solution to a panel of judges.</p>

                        <h2>Essays on Technology</h2>
                        <p style="padding-top: 1.5rem;">Participants (three [3] individuals per state) write a research-based essay (using two or more sources provided on-site) that makes insightful connections about a current technological topic.</p>

                        <h2>Music Production</h2>
                        <p style="padding-top: 1.5rem;">Participants (three [3] teams per state; an individual may participate solo in this team event) produce an original musical piece that is designed to be played during the National TSA Conference opening or closing general sessions.</p>

                        <h2>Technology Problem Solving</h2>
                        <p style="padding-top: 1.5rem;">Participants (one [1] team of two [2] members per chapter) use their skills in problem solving to develop a finite solution to a problem provided on site.</p>

                        <h2>Transportation Modeling</h2>
                        <p style="padding-top: 1.5rem;">Participants (one [1] individual per chapter) research, design, and produce a scale model of a vehicle that fits the annual design problem.</p>

                        <h2>Video Game Design</h2>
                        <p style="padding-top: 1.5rem;">Participants (three [3] teams per state) develop a game that focuses on the yearly theme. The game must have high artistic, educational, and social value and be interesting, exciting, visually appealing, and intellectually challenging.</p>

                        <h2>Webmaster</h2>
                        <p style="padding-top: 1.5rem;">Participants (one [1] team of three to five [3-5] members per chapter) design, build, and launch a website that features the school’s career and technology/engineering program, the TSA chapter, and the chapter’s ability to research and present a given topic pertaining to technology. Semifinalists participate in an onsite interview to demonstrate the knowledge and expertise gained during the development of the website—with an emphasis on web design methods and practices, as well as their research for the annual design topic.</p>
